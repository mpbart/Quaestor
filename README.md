## Overview
This is a CRM I've been building for personal use. It's useful for me to aggregate the websites I look at frequently in a single place. Plus it's a good excuse for me to mess around with rails and learn the framework better. Currently only hackernews and twitter are supported but I'm looking into others as well. I may also build in a finance tracker in the future by leveraging Plaid (tbd).

* Supports ruby version 2.6.5
* Fill out config.json with your personal secrets for gathering data. Currently only twitter has been added but there will likely be others in the future. (Make sure not to commit this file though)
